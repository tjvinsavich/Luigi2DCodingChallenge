//Guide Luigi home by following the trail of "0"s from left to right and top to bottom in the 2D matrix.

//Give him directions with two commands:

//"Down" or "Right";

//Example:
//input:

//        [4,0,4]
//        [5,0,0]
//        [6,9,0]
//        [8,3,0]

//        output:

//String "Down Right Down Down"

//(Note: In all the tests Luigi will have clear path.So there will only be a "0" below or to the right of each other.No isolated "0"s or "0"s moving back left.)
